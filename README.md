# CloudSmart AWS Marktetplace Data Prep Workshop
Customer Data Prep Workshop for CloudSmart LLC

## Introduction
CloudSmart customers are sellers within the AWS Marketplace and are looking for insights into their sales activities.  Our goal in this data prep workshop is to create the guardrails and least security principle access to that data.  Ultimately that data will be consumed by the CloudSmart Jetstream engine to provide meaningful sales analytics, reporting, and connectivity to customers.
## Pre-requisites
An AWS Account is required. Basic knowledge of AWS foundational services such as Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Amazon S3 are strongly encouraged.  Given that this dataset is based on the AWS Marketplace, being a seller in the AWS Marketplace is also required. Access to the AWS Account associated with the marketplace management portal and appropriate IAM permissions are also necessary. see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/data-feed.html

Before getting beginning the workshop, you need to follow these preparation steps. The workshop is designed with a "bring your own data" mindset, these instructions are here to help you prepare your own dataset.

## Additional Pre-requisite for AWS Marketplace Sellers
To access data feeds, you need to configure your environment to receive data feeds to an encrypted Amazon S3 bucket. AWS Marketplace provides an AWS CloudFormation template that you can use to simplify configuration. https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-marketplace-reports-resources/DataFeedsResources.yaml
